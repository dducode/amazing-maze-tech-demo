# Maze Technical Demo

It's my project created for demonstrate maze procedural generation. 
You can clone the project and open it in Unity Editor or [download the build](https://github.com/dducode/maze-tech-demo/releases/download/1.0.0/maze-tech-demo.zip) and check it without engine.

* You can generate orthogonal maze with size from `(4;4)` to `(50;50)`
* Explore the maze as you wish

In the build:
* Press right mouse button and WASD to move and QE to raise and lower camera
* Hold down the mouse wheel to move camera
* Roll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
