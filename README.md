# Maze Technical Demo

It's my project created for demonstrate maze procedural generation. 
You can clone the project and open it in Unity Editor or upload the build and check it without engine.

* You can generate orthogonal maze with size from `(4;4)` to `(50;50)`
* Explore the maze as you wish

In the build:
* Press right mouse button and WASD to move and QE to raise and lower camera
* Roll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
